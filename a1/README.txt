CREATIVE COMPONENT

(1) GENERAL COMMENTS


(2) A FEW THINGS I LEARNED WHILE WORKING ON THE CREATIVE COMPONENT

- Using different lighting effects, such as spotlight, point, and directional lights.
- Experimenting with different materials, so light reflects on it naturally.
- Importing multiple object models found from the website.
- Applying textures to object models.

(3) ATTRIBUTIONS -- CODE or DATA borrowed from elsewhere

- Pawn object model, and textures.
